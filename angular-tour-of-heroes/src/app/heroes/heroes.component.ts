  // While you could call getHeroes() in the constructor, 
  // that's not the best practice.
  // Reserve the constructor for simple initialization 
  // such as wiring constructor parameters to properties. 
  // The constructor shouldn't do anything. 
  // It certainly shouldn't call a function that makes HTTP requests 
  // to a remote server as a real data service would.
  // Instead, call getHeroes() inside the ngOnInit lifecycle hook and 
  // let Angular call ngOnInit at an appropriate time after constructing a 
  // HeroesComponent instance.

  onSelect(hero: Hero): void {
    this.selectedHero = hero;
  }

  //getHeroes(): void {
  //  this.heroes = this.heroService.getHeroes();
  //}
  // This will not work in a real app. 
  // You're getting away with it now because the service currently returns mock heroes. 
  // But soon the app will fetch heroes from a remote server, 
  // which is an inherently asynchronous operation.

  getHeroes(): void {
    this.heroService.getHeroes()
        .subscribe(heroes => this.heroes = heroes);
  }
  // Observable.subscribe() is the critical difference.
  // The previous version assigns an array of heroes to the component's 
  // heroes property. The assignment occurs synchronously, as if the server 
  // could return heroes instantly or the browser could freeze the UI while 
  // it waited for the server's response.
  // That won't work when the HeroService is actually making requests of a 
  // remote server.
  // The new version waits for the Observable to emit the array of heroesâ€” 
  // which could happen now or several minutes from now. 
  // Then subscribe passes the emitted array to the callback, 
  // which sets the component's heroes property.
  // This asynchronous approach will work when the HeroService requests 
  // heroes from the server.
