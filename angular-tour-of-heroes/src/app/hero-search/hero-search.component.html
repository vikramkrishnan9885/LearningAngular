<div id="search-component">
  <h4>Hero Search</h4>
 
  <input #searchBox id="search-box" (input)="search(searchBox.value)" />
  <!-- 
    As the user types in the search box, an input event binding calls 
    the component's search() method with the new search box value.

  <ul class="search-result">
    <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes$ | async" >
      <!--
        AsyncPipe
        ============
          As expected, the *ngFor repeats hero objects.
          Look closely and you'll see that the *ngFor iterates over a list 
          called heroes$, not heroes.

          The $ is a convention that indicates heroes$ is an Observable, 
          not an array.

          The *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable. 
          But there's also a pipe character (|) followed by async, 
          which identifies Angular's AsyncPipe.

          The AsyncPipe subscribes to an Observable automatically so you 
          won't have to do so in the component class.
